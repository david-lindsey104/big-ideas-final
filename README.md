Overview:
  1. We determined which neighborhood in Pittsburgh was the best by seeing how "healthy" it was. To determine how healthy a neighborhood is, we used data sets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional 
  Data Center. We looked at each neighborhood's air quality index number because the more pollutants in the air the lesser quality of health. Also, we looked at how many hosptials were in each 
  neighborhood because that would give the population a higher access to primary care. Lastly, we looked at how many fast food restaraunts there are in each neighborhood because the more fast food 
  establishments the less healthy there are food options that are available to the population.
